# Day 27: String Slicing in Python

## Introduction
String slicing in Python is used to extract a specific part of a string.
It allows us to get characters from a string by using **index positions**.

Strings are indexed starting from `0`.

## What is String Slicing?
String slicing means taking a portion of a string using **start** and **end** indexes.

### Syntax
```python
string[start : end]
```
- `start` → starting index (included)
- `end` → ending index (excluded)

## Summary
- String slicing extracts parts of a string
- Uses indexes to control start and end positions
- Very useful for text manipulation in Python programs
